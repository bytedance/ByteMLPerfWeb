## Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source projects hosted or managed by Bytedance Ltd. and/or its Affiliates ("ByteDance"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, ByteDance must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ByteDance and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

- If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA.

- If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual CLA.

- If you have not already done so, please complete and sign, then scan and email a pdf file of this Agreement to opensource-cla@bytedance.com. Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.   

##  Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Make sure your code lints.
- If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/bytedance/ByteMLPerf/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/bytedance/ByteMLPerf/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.
